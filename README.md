# MultiThreaded Client Server in C

This project was written in C and contains a multithreaded client server system for multiprocessing in both Unix and Win32. 
This system is comprised of: 
* A multi-threaded Server.
* A single-threaded Client Process. 

This project was an assignment for my Systems Programming subject at University.
